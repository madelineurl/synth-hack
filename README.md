# Synth Time!
This is a basic web-based synthesizer inspired by the Korg Minilogue. It's a highly oversimplified version in its current state, but I plan to continue building on it until I have a fairly convincing Minilogue clone. Built using Tone.js and React.

# 2022 Note

I've learned a lot about design patterns and clean code over the last year since I built this, and cringe at some of this code now. Currently working on some updates to this project to make it more DRY and further build out the functionality.
